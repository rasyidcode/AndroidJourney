## Kotlin Eat It
This repo is actually some tutorial from youtube by EDMT Dev which is a great man who write code and making walkthrough build apps
and it helps beginner like me a lot :) Actually the code he write is Java with old gradle because he uploaded the video in 2017
which is 2 years ago, and it's gonna be challenge for me to convert to old code into newer one. And also i am not using Java to
remake the program but Kotlin, why Kotlin? because i am learning it right now.

### Part 1
So part 1 just completed, it takes 4 days to complete because im f*cking lazy person :D but the thing is i completed the part 1
and ready to go to the next part. but before i do that im gonna tell about the part 1 a little bit, in 2017 maybe there's no
material component that's why he(EDMT Dev) using old button and edit text library which cause me a lot of error because the library
seems not working today, so i decided to use material component by google and it looks much more beautiful than the tutorial has. The 
other challenge is that i have to figure how to convert firebase database to firestore, which is so hard and i just learn kotlin, so 
i need help from internet which is stackoverflow and other community and medium, but anyway part 1 is completed so i need to move to the next one.
